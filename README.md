Easily set up you developer machine.
Just run the script.sh, add the softwares that needs to be installed, sit back and relax. Let the script do the work.

Initial code was developed only for Ubuntu machines. Since, Macintosh machines do not have the provision of apt-get, I am trying to develop a version for the Mac. Set up your Mac, each time you get it, or format it by mistake. 

Development is currently in early stage. Feel free to take a look at the code. Contributions are welcome.
