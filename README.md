Easily set up you developer machine.
Just run the script.sh, add the softwares that needs to be installed, sit back and relax. Let the script do the work.
Whenever i do a fresh install of ubuntu, it was not easy for me to turn it into my dev machine. I had to visit several websites, copy all those lines of commands to install my required softwares. Now, i just run the script, add the softwares to install and let the code do the work.

Development is currently in early stage. Feel free to take a look at the code. Contributions are welcome.
